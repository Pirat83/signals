# Signals
signals generated based on algorithms for paper trading
None of these are intended to be correct. It is just a fun project.


This project is to use various trading algorithms and generate python based output for each algorithm indicating which ticker to hold at the time of run for each algorithm. Algorithm are identified as symphony and the outputs as tickers or signals.

Any changes in links will be updated here going forward.
