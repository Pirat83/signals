# Signals
signals generated based on algorithms for paper trading


This project is to use various trading algorithms and generate python based output for each algorithm indicating which ticker to hold at the time of run for each algorithm. Algorithm are identified as symphony and the outputs as tickers or signals.

Mappings of various composer symphony and the short names used in output sheet -- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1duub-kYJIrBrEEbuytyWt7L7xuD-BmkwCTH86usd4oI/edit#gid=0

Gist file that shows code, where line number can be mapped in Singal2/Signal historical file to find the branch which triggered the signal
